I like the direction you're taking. The current project demonstrates the core idea (AI Agent → Notification Service), but if your goal is to make it a portfolio-quality project or something that could gain traction on GitHub, I'd expand it from a simple notification service into an **AI Agent Event Bus**.

Instead of being "another notification app," position it as:

> **A standardized notification and event delivery platform for autonomous AI agents using Webhooks, MCP, and intelligent routing.**

This aligns well with where the AI ecosystem (OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.) is heading.

# Vision

Build a notification infrastructure specifically designed for AI agents.

Instead of merely sending notifications, the platform should become an **event hub** where AI agents publish events and humans subscribe to meaningful notifications.

Think of it as:

> GitHub Webhooks + Slack Alerts + MCP Server + Event Bus

but specifically designed for AI agents.

# New Features

## 1. Event Timeline

Every AI event gets stored.

```
10:00

Agent Started

↓

10:02

Loading Dataset

↓

10:12

Training Finished

↓

10:13

Accuracy 95%

↓

10:14

Deployment Complete
```

Now it becomes observability.

---

## 2. Smart Rules

Instead of:

```
Notify()
```

Users define

```
IF

accuracy < 0.9

THEN

Push Notification
```

or

```
IF

event == "deployment_failed"

THEN

Telegram
```

---

## 3. AI Event Schema

Create a standard event schema.

```json
{
  "event":"model.training.completed",
  "agent":"training-agent",
  "severity":"info",
  "timestamp":"",
  "metadata":{
      "accuracy":0.94,
      "epochs":15
  }
}
```

Like CloudEvents but AI focused.

---

## 4. MCP Server

One-click integration.

Claude Desktop

Cursor

VS Code

OpenAI Agents

can directly call

```
notify_user()
```

through MCP.

Python

```python
from notify import AgentNotifier

notify.success(
    title="Training Complete",
    message="Accuracy reached 96%"

```javascript
notify.info(...)

# Microsoft Spec-Driven Development Prompt

Below is a spec-driven prompt inspired by Microsoft's Specification-Driven Development (SDD) approach. It is designed for GitHub Copilot Chat, ChatGPT, Claude, or any coding agent to produce architecture, APIs, and implementation from a formal specification rather than ad hoc code.

```text
# Role

You are a Senior Software Architect and Principal Engineer.

Your goal is to design and implement a production-ready AI Agent Notification Platform.

Do not immediately generate code.

Instead, follow Specification-Driven Development.

Work through each phase sequentially and wait for approval before moving to the next.

---

# Product

Build "Agentic Notify", an event-driven notification platform for autonomous AI agents.

The system should allow AI agents to publish events via Webhooks, REST APIs, or the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Events are validated, processed through configurable rules, stored for observability, and dispatched to multiple notification channels such as Push, Slack, Discord, Telegram, Email, SMS, and Webhooks.

The platform should be scalable, extensible, secure, cloud-native, and production-ready.

---

Each issue should include:

- Description
- Acceptance Criteria
- Dependencies
- Estimated Effort
- Labels

---

# Deliverables

Produce each phase as a standalone Markdown document suitable for the `/docs/specs/` directory.

Do not skip phases.

Do not generate production code until all specifications have been reviewed and approved.

Prefer clean architecture, DDD, event-driven architecture, SOLID principles, and cloud-native patterns throughout the design.
```

This approach will give you a much stronger project than a simple notification service. It becomes a **production-grade AI notification infrastructure** that showcases system design, event-driven architecture, MCP integration, SDK development, and cloud-native engineering—all highly valuable skills for recruiters and open-source contributors.
