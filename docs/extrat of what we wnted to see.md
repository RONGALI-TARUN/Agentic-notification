This is actually the **most important question** to answer before building more features. If your project is just "Grafana alerts but for AI," it won't stand out. The goal is to identify what existing tools do well, what they don't, and where an AI-native platform can add value.

---

# First, where existing tools fit

| Platform   | Primary Purpose              | Strength                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Grafana    | Infrastructure observability | Metrics, dashboards, alerting |
| Datadog    | Cloud monitoring             | Infrastructure + APM + Logs   |
| Prometheus | Metrics collection           | Time-series metrics           |
| Sentry     | Error monitoring             | Exceptions & stack traces     |
| PagerDuty  | Incident response            | Escalations and on-call       |
| Slack      | Notifications                | Human communication           |

These tools answer questions like:

* Is the CPU high?
* Is memory low?
* Is the API returning 500?
* Did Kubernetes restart?
* Is latency above 200 ms?

They are designed around **machines and infrastructure**.

# What AI systems care about

An AI agent is not just a server.

It has concepts like:

```
Goal

↓

Planning

↓

Reasoning

↓

Tool Calls

↓

Memory

↓

LLM

↓

Reflection

↓

Retry

↓

Success
```

Infrastructure monitoring doesn't understand any of these.

For example:

```
Research Agent

↓

Searching Google

↓

Found 5 papers

↓

Summarized

↓

Confidence = 63%

↓

Retrying

↓

Using another model

↓

Done
```

Grafana sees:

```
POST /search

200 OK

Latency 120ms
```

It has no understanding of the agent's reasoning process.

---

# The gap

Your project should monitor **agent behavior**, not just infrastructure.

Instead of asking:

> "Is my server healthy?"

It asks:

> "Is my AI making good decisions?"

---

# AI-native Events

Instead of CPU metrics, your system captures events like:

```
Agent Started

↓

Plan Generated

↓

Tool Failed

↓

Memory Retrieved

↓

Model Switched

↓

Human Approval Needed

↓

Task Completed
```

These events don't exist in Grafana today.

---

# Think of your project as

```
Grafana

+

GitHub Actions

+

LangSmith

+

Slack

+

MCP

+

AI Timeline
```

This combination is much closer to the value proposition.

---

# Features worth borrowing from Grafana

Grafana has excellent UX patterns you can adapt for AI workflows.

## 1. Live Dashboard

Current

```
CPU

Memory

Disk
```

Yours

```
Running Agents

Completed Today

Failed

Waiting for Human

Retries

Average Completion Time
```

---

## 2. Event Timeline

Grafana:

```
CPU

Memory

Logs
```

Yours:

```
10:00

Research Started

↓

10:02

Searching

↓

10:03

Tool Failed

↓

10:05

Retry

↓

10:06

Success

↓

10:07

Summary Generated
```

This becomes an "explainability timeline."

---

## 3. Alert Rules

Grafana supports rules like:

```
CPU > 90%
```

You can define AI-centric rules such as:

```
IF

Agent Retry > 5

Notify
```

or

```
IF

Hallucination Score > 0.7

Notify
```

or

```
IF

Reasoning Time > 2 min

Create Incident
```

---

## 4. Alert Routing

Grafana routes alerts to Slack, Email, or PagerDuty.

You can extend this by routing based on agent context.

```
Research Agent

↓

Discord

Coding Agent

↓

Slack

Deployment Agent

↓

PagerDuty
```

---

## 5. Query Language

Grafana has PromQL.

You could introduce an **Agent Query Language (AQL)**.

Examples:

```
agent.name = "ResearchAgent"

AND

status = FAILED
```

or

```
tool = browser

AND

latency > 20 sec
```

or

```
reasoning_steps > 30
```

This lets users search and analyze agent behavior directly.

---

# Features to borrow from Datadog

Datadog is strong in distributed tracing.

You could trace an entire AI workflow.

```
User Prompt

↓

Planner

↓

Retriever

↓

LLM

↓

Web Search

↓

Memory

↓

Code Tool

↓

Response
```

Each step would have:

* Start time
* End time
* Cost
* Tokens
* Duration
* Status

This is far more meaningful for AI systems than a simple request trace.

# AI-specific features to build

These are the kinds of capabilities that make your project unique.

# Execution roadmap

Instead of trying to clone Grafana, build toward an AI-native observability platform.

### Phase 1 — Foundation (2–3 weeks)

* Webhook ingestion
* REST API
* MCP server
* Event schema
* Topic management
* Basic push notifications

**Outcome:** AI agents can publish standardized events.

---

### Phase 2 — Observability (3–4 weeks)

* Event timeline
* Live dashboard
* Event filtering
* Search
* Event replay
* Delivery history

**Outcome:** Users can inspect agent execution.

---

### Phase 3 — Intelligence (4–5 weeks)

* Rule engine
* AI-specific alerts
* Deduplication
* Retry policies
* Multi-channel notifications
* Cost and token analytics

**Outcome:** Smart, actionable notifications instead of raw events.

---

### Phase 4 — AI Platform (5–6 weeks)

* Agent registry
* Workflow tracing
* Human approval flows
* SDKs (Python, TypeScript)
* LangGraph integration
* CrewAI integration
* OpenAI Agents SDK integration

**Outcome:** A platform that AI developers can integrate into their ecosystems.

---

## The long-term vision

Rather than competing with Grafana or Datadog, position your project as an **AI Observability and Notification Platform**.

A concise positioning statement could be:

> **Grafana tells you if your servers are healthy. Agentic Notify tells you if your AI agents are healthy.**

That distinction is clear, easy to communicate, and addresses a growing need as autonomous AI systems become more common.
